However, this expansion should only occur where adequate equipment can be provided. In the case of ventilator shortages, the use of transport, operating theatre, and military ventilators may be required. To reduce strain on ICUs, elective surgeries should be postponed, and lower-acuity patients discharged to other areas, including designated deescalation wards for recovering ICU patients with COVID-19 who might still require isolation. Triage for critical care units should be considered as well as rationing of resources in the case of insufficient resources to meet the demands. Preparations must also focus on potential staff shortages due to an overwhelming patient demand as well as potential loss of staff due to illness.

The study found out, these measures impact the transmission rate by 10% reduction, therefore closure of school and increase telework will have more contact in the community but reduction of transfer of pathogens among children which is a source of pathogen transfer to adults.

The results are shown in Figure 8, where the peak has moved from day 30 to day 25, with a significant slowing in the number of new cases. The total number of dead individuals has decreased, and the number of dead individuals per day at the peak has decreased from 22 K to 13 K, approximately. Extreme isolation after imperfect isolation anticipates the process. Figure 9 shows the results if the isolation measures start two days before, at day 20 instead of day 22.

However, whether SD alone is enough to flatten the epidemic curve is debatable.;Results: Implementing SD only delayed the appearance of peak prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Doubling of hospital beds could not reduce the fatal cases probably due to its overwhelming number compared to the hospital beds. Increasing detection rates could significantly flatten the curve and reduce the peak prevalence of cases (increasing detection rate by 5 times could reduce case number to half). Conclusions: An effective strategy to contain the epidemic spread of COVID-19 in India is to increase detection rates in combination with SD measures and increase in hospital beds.;;4/29/2020;regions: Kerala;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results. Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2-4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions. Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered.

With current interventions remaining in place to at least the end of March, we estimate that interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59,000 deaths up to 31 March [95% credible interval 21,000-120,000]. Many more deaths will be averted through ensuring that interventions remain in place until transmission drops to low levels. It is therefore critical that the current interventions remain in place and trends in cases and deaths are closely monitored in the coming days and weeks to provide reassurance that transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is slowing.;;4/25/2020;countries: 11;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Importantly, political leaders must enact quarantine and social-distancing policies that do not bias against any population group. The legacies of social and economic injustices perpetrated in the name of public health have lasting repercussions. Interventions might pose risks of reduced income and even job loss, disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged populations: policies to lessen such risks are urgently needed. Special attention should be given to protections for vulnerable populations, such as homeless, incarcerated, older, or disabled individuals, and undocumented migrants. Similarly, exceptions might be necessary for certain groups, including people who are reliant on ongoing medical treatment. The effectiveness and societal impact of quarantine and social distancing will depend on the credibility of public health authorities, political leaders, and institutions. It is important that policy makers maintain the public's trust through use of evidence-based interventions and fully transparent, fact-based communication.;;4/25/2020;-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, medical resources should be increased in cities under lockdown. Implementation of these measures would reduce the spread of the virus to other cities and allow appropriate treatment of patients in cities under lockdown.

We showed that change points in the spreading rate affect the confirmed case numbers with a delay of about two weeks (median reporting delay of D = 11.4 days plus a median change-point duration of 3 days). Thereby, we were able to relate the inferred change points to the three major governmental interventions in Germany: We found a clear reduction of the spreading rate related to each governmental intervention (Fig. 3), (i) the cancellation of large events with more than 1000 participants (around March 9), (ii) the closing of schools, childcare centers and the majority of stores (in effect March 16), and (iii) the contact ban and closing of all non-essential stores (in effect March 23).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Bayesian model;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 - 4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Two deletions (three nucleotides and twenty-four nucleotides) were in the ORF1ab polyprotein, and one deletion (ten nucleotides) was in the 3′ end of the genome. Ninety-three mutations over the entire genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1). Forty-two missense mutations were identified in all the major non-structural and structural proteins, except the envelope protein. Twenty-nine missense mutations were in the ORF1ab polyprotein, eight in the spike surface glycoprotein, one in the matrix protein, and four in the nucleocapsid protein. Of note, three mutations (D354, Y364, and F367) located in the spike surface glycoprotein receptor-binding domain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The medical comorbidity grade and operative outcomes were defined in accordance with the recommended reporting standards and best practice documents from the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and European Society for Vascular Surgery. Complications were recorded as perioperative (<30 days) or late (>1 month) and classified as graft-related or procedurerelated. The complications were described as mild (spontaneous resolution or with nominal intervention, did not prolong the hospital stay, and/or did not cause permanent disability), moderate (required significant intervention, prolonged hospitalization for >24 hours, resulted in a minor amputation, or was associated with a minor disability that did not interfere with normal daily activities), or severe (necessitated a major surgical, medical, and/or endovascular intervention or resulted in prolonged convalescence, major amputation, permanent disability, or death). Major amputations were classified as transfemoral or transtibial. Minor amputations were any toe or forefoot amputation and were not considered in the analysis of freedom from amputation. Successful revascularization of the treated segment was defined as the absence of early (<30 days) reocclusion or persistent forefoot ischemia or major amputation or death within 24 hours. The primary outcomes were successful revascularization, early (<30 days) and late survival, postoperative (<30 days) complications, and limb salvage at the last clinical evaluation available at least 7 days after revascularization.;Y;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Moreover, 23% of patients were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, pointing out the importance of considering VTE complications in COVID-19 patients. This study is limited in the small number of patients and the retrospective design of the study. However, given the systematic VTE screening strategy and the severity of the anticoagulated patients, our results support to consider routine screening of VTE in severe ICU COVID-19 patients in the pandemic context and suggest taking into consideration early therapeutic anticoagulation in this setting.;We performed a retrospective study in 2 French intensive care units (ICU) were CDU is performed as a standard of care. A CDU from thigh to ankle at selected sites with Doppler waveforms and images was performed early during ICU stay in patients admitted with COVID-19.

Given the available knowledge on their safety profiles, and in some cases efficacy against closely related coronaviruses, repurposing existing antiviral agents is a potentially important near-term strategy to tackle 2019-nCoV. Phase III trials of remdesivir have been initiated, and many other trials are being established in China to test various treatment options such as umifenovir, oseltamivir and ASC09F (Supplementary Table 1). In addition, more than 50 existing MERS and/or SARS inhibitors, such as galidesivir, the protease inhibitors GC813 and compound 3k, the helicase inhibitor SSYA10‑001 and the nucleoside analogue pyrazofurin (Supplementary Table 1) could be screened against 2019-nCoV by facilities that have appropriate biocontainment capability. However, the reported EC50 and IC50 values of existing MERS and/or SARS inhibitors are mostly in the micromolar range, and further optimization of their activities against 2019-nCoV is probably needed before agents would be ready for clinical evaluation.;-;-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It should be noted that these results were obtained solely by in silico predictions, further experiments are needed to validate the efficacy of these drugs.
